## Built With
Back end
  * [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-mongodb) - Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store. 
  * [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) - Takes an opinionated view of building production-ready Spring applications. Spring Boot favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
  * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
